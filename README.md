# 1652---Music-Genre-Recognition
Music Genre Recognition using Deep Learning


Music is growing beyond any reach because it doesnâ€™t have any cultural and Music Industries are 
nowadays working to handle millions of data around the world. We picked up Music Information 
Retrieval task and presented a system that will automatically extract relevant features from audio 
for a given task. We used deep learning algorithms such as Dilated CNN (Convolutional Neural 
Network) and Bilinear CNN on spectrograms of different genres extracted using Short Time 
Fourier Transform (STFTs) we started our work with a baseline model such as Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Classifier and Logistic Regression applied 
on the metadata provided by FMA (Free Music Archive).
